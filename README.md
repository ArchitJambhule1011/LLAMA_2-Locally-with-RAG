# Running LLAMA 2 Locally with Hugging Face and Compression Techniques
## Project Description

This project explores running the powerful LLAMA 2 language model locally using the Hugging Face library and leveraging compression techniques to reduce its resource footprint.

## Key Skills & Technologies:

Hugging Face Transformers: Familiarity with model loading, inference, and configuration
Python: Ability to work with libraries and write basic scripts
Compression Techniques (Optional): Knowledge of techniques like quantization (e.g., GPTQ) or knowledge distillation
Project Activities:

## Environment Setup:

Install Python and necessary libraries like Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on model format).
Ensure compatibility between libraries and your GPU (if available).

## Model Selection:

Explore pre-trained LLAMA 2 models available on the Hugging Face Hub through the Transformers library.
Consider smaller versions like "Llama-v2-7b-guanaco" for reduced memory requirements.

## Compression (Optional):

Implement techniques like quantization (e.g., using the GPTQ library) to reduce model size and memory footprint.
This step requires additional research and understanding of specific libraries.

## Hugging Face Integration:

Use the Transformers library to load the pre-trained or compressed model.
Leverage built-in functionalities for tasks like text generation, translation, or question answering.

## Fine-tuning (Optional):

If desired, fine-tune the loaded model on your specific dataset using Hugging Face's fine-tuning capabilities.
Experimentation:

Test and evaluate the model's performance on various tasks.
Explore different inference techniques and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
